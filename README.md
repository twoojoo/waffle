# Waffle - A fluent Fastify wrapper that makes HTTP servers stupidly easy

## Install

```bash
npm i @twoojoo/waffle
```

## Description

Waffle allows you to spin up an HTTP server using [Fastyfy](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) with a completely fluent syntax. 
It supports route types and schemas and all main Fastify features, while fully allowing to interact with the underlying Fastify instance.
It also comes shipped with some useful plugins such as rate limter and cors, to further decrease development time.
